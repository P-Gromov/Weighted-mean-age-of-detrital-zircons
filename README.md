This is a tool to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean age of detrital zircons.
Paste ages and sigma from Excel (first column - ages). Decimal separators “,” or “.”
Recommended number of entries - not more than 50.
The algorithm takes a youngest group of at least 4 zircons with overlapping intervals of age +/- 1sigma.
