This is a tool to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean age of detrital zircons.
You should paste ages and sigma from Excel (first column - ages). 
Decimal separators should be “,” or “.”
Recommended number of entries - not more than 50.

The algorithm takes a youngest cluster of n zircons overlapping in age at 1σ.
If the programm does not respond - reduce cluster size - probably your data contains not enough zircons overlapping in age at 1σ.
This method is described in the following paper (at page 117): Dickinson, W.R., Gehrels, G.E., 2009. Use of U-Pb ages of detrital zircons to infer maximum depositional ages of strata: a test against a Colorado Plateau Mesozoic database. Earth and Planetary Science Letter 288, 115e125.
